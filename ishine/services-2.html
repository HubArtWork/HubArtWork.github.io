				<p>In practice, standard cleaning is not always effective. Sometimes there are difficult situations when premises are too dirty or contaminated with organic or inorganic substances, the removal of which requires the use of special cleaning materials, chemicals and equipment.</p>
				<p>Such works are usually called deep cleaning. In the process of deep cleaning, it is possible to remove pollution of a complex nature and return the room to its original appearance.</p>
				<p>Removing complex contaminations often requires the use of special cleaning equipment, materials, chemicals and experienced and qualified specialists in order to get the results that the customer initially expects.</p>
				<p>Despite the fact that there are many small and large companies operating in the New York cleaning market today, not all of them can offer you a deep cleaning service. Even those cleaning companies that provide their customers with a deep cleaning service cannot always ensure the appropriate quality of their work carried out due to its high complexity and diffifulty.</p>
				<span class="page-subtitle">Make the right choice!</span>
				<p>If you need high-quality deep cleaning, then choose the service from a proven cleaning company. Our company Cleaning Master has been operating in the New York City cleaning market for many years, having successfully completed a lot of facilities.</p>
				<p>The company provides its customers with a high-quality deep cleaning service thanks to the capital that has been accumulated over many years of its successful work. This capital currently includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Extensive experience in deep cleaning of complex facilities;</li>
					<li>A large friendly and solid staff of qualified and experienced employees of various trades;</li>
					<li>Advanced cleaning technologies;</li>
					<li>Advanced contemporary powerful cleaning equipment;</li>
					<li>Effective, reliable, environmentally friendly and safe chemicals and materials.</li>
					<li>When should you use deep cleaning?</li>
					<li>In short, deep cleaning is used when common cleaning (spring cleaning, regular cleaning, etc.) does not give the required results in terms of quality.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For example, regular cleaning copes well with ordinary surfaces in  a kitchen or bathroom, but cleaning a gas stove, oven, refrigerator, freezer, or plumbing equipment often requires the use of special equipment and synthetic detergents.</p>
				<p>Deep cleaning is also necessary to remove dust and dirt from hard-to-reach places. Another typical use of deep cleaning is the removal of complex contaminants. Most often, surfaces are contaminated with organic matter (for example, oil stains on carpets), which require the use of special organic cleaning agents (for example, solvents) to remove.</p>
				<p>Naturally, all cleaning products used for deep cleaning must be safe, environmentally friendly, reliable and effective. Sometimes deep cleaning is also used to remove dust and dirt, which are based on finely dispersed inorganic substances.</p>
				<p>In such cases, specialists resort to a vacuum cleaner. However, specialists don’t use an ordinary vacuum cleaner, which is able to effectively cope just with ordinary house dust. They use a professional one, capable of collecting fine dust.</p>
				<p>If your room requires deep cleaning, be sure to contact us by phone or email as soon as possible. We are certain to send an expert to your site who will be able to correctly assess the complexity of all upcoming work.</p>
