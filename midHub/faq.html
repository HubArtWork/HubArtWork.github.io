							<h1 class="page-title">Our mission</h1>
							<div class="contacts-text">MIDHUB is a platform for the conscious individuals, who choose safe and effective interaction with the world around them while maintaining control over their personal data, and for the organizations that respect their customers.</div>
						</div>
						<div class="contacts-block" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-once="true">
							<p>One of the key conditions for society development is the identification of each individual and their property. Obviously, without this, we could hardly create nations and global markets. What is more important for each of us is the identification of ourselves as human beings. This is the main development vector for nations and markets of the future. An important part of the individual’s self-identification is his or her personal data. Losing control over this data means not just losing his or her confidentiality and the right to choose, but also a part of the individual him/herself. If we pursue developing a society, the center of which is a human being, our common task is to create conditions contributing to the preservation of his or her integrity.  Only by creating an environment which guarantees individuals control over their personal data we can emerge as a healthy society.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="contacts-block" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-once="true">
							<p>Today, the majority of organizations strive to collect as much information about their users as possible to use it to their own advantage. Unfortunately, these interests do not always align with the users’. For example, Facebook, YouTube and other organizations access a large amount of user data that individuals cannot control. It is obvious that nowadays data collected by companies is often used for commercial purposes without users’ consent, which infringes their rights.</p>
							<p>Interacting with different organizations everyday, each of us trusts them with our personal data. This is how an independent repository with users data is created, whose owners have their own commercial goals and understanding of data storage  security. As a result of this communication, on a daily basis we are increasing the amount of data storage we do not control, expanding our zone of vulnerability. Today's solutions allow for neither secure access to your data nor a convenient way to keep track of your data transmission. Moreover, centralized data warehouses are the target of numerous attacks, and as the experience shows these repositories are not secure. It is enough to hack just one database with the lowest security barrier to illegally gain access to user data. Losing control over your data becomes a barrier to exercising your rights. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="contacts-block" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-once="true">
							<p>In addition, it should be noted that current forms of identification are still not available to 1.1 billion people around the world. As a result, despite the above-mentioned risks, 1/7 of the world population is completely deprived of the right to own their personality. Lack of opportunity to obtain identity documents deprives a person of the right to vote in elections, the right to own property, the opportunity to connect to a financial system, to get education, to work, etc. This shows that the current situation serves the private commercial interest rather than fostering integrity and harmonious development of an individual. Consequently, it becomes clear that the development of a modern healthy society is impossible without a foundation, which is based on the individual's control over his or her identity and related data.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="contacts-block" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-once="true">
							<p>In the search for such a solution, we have identified a few factors that must be taken into account in this work. Since personal data is one of the key elements of the individual’s interaction with the outside world, such as state, public, commercial, financial and educational institutions, a personal data management solution should comprehensively cover these areas and have the flexibility to scale further. Based on this approach, the concept of a platform has been developed with a human being at its center. The logic of user’s interaction with participants on this platform should provide a user with the possibility to store reliable personal data, and to present this data to external market participants. In doing so, a user should have full control over his or her data and an opportunity to manage the access to this data. To ensure personal data security and the user rights, the following key priorities were defined: user data security and decentralization of the platform operation.  Having defined the concept and key priorities, we commenced developing the platform.</p>

							<h2 class="contacts-title">About Midhub</h2>
							<p>MIDHUB platform is a new and advanced way of personal data management and protection. Creating a higher level of security in the domain of personal data management became possible due to technological advances, such as the growing complexity of smartphones, decentralized storage, cryptography, the emergence of block technology and smart contracts. The platform is based on  decentralization, and the entire logic of the interaction between participants is carried out directly without third-party intervention, and is guaranteed by a smart contract. Due to the above mentioned technologies, we have managed to optimize and significantly shorten business processes for all types of organizations and platform participants, while significantly enhancing their efficiency and security. Taking into account the interests of everyone, we are striving to create a basis for further development of the platform, the center of which is a human being and his or her  rights.  With the help of MIDHUB platform a user can open access to his or her personal database for an unlimited number of web resources and organizations without the need to remember what data and data processing permissions he or she has provided.  In addition to controlling access to the data provided, users may monitor who and under what condition is processing their data. A single password in the entire Internet space based on biometric data, allows users to register or confirm their identity at an organization or a web resource within a few seconds, temporarily disclosing only the necessary part of their personal data. Transaction privacy together with a reasonable degree of transparency allows users maintain control over the integrity of their identity and to defend their rights in a timely manner. </p>

						<div class="contacts-block" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-once="true">
							<p>For users who do not even possess a legal  identity card, the platform can become a kind of "digital passport". The technological solutions used in the platform create the necessary level of trust for web resources, ensuring that each customer is a unique person. This gives an opportunity to individuals who do not possess a legal identity card to get access to the services that have been traditionally unavailable to them.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="contacts-block" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-once="true">
							<p>Having a high level of users’ data security and their data control as the key priorities, now we are making the moves in the direction of providing users with the opportunity for safe  interaction with public, commercial, financial, educational and other institutions. </p>
